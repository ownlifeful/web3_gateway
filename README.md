# web3_gateway

A caching DNS server that looks up domains on the polygon blockchain.

This software makes web3 more accessible by resolving web3 domains, such as .crypto, to IP addresses in a fast and efficient manner.

To be able to resolve a .crypto domain to an IP address, one would have to run this DNS server and add its IP address to the bottom of one's DNS server chain.

All the usual web2 domains, such as .com, would continue to function as usual. Lookups for .crypto would fall to our server.

This simple DNS change could be done via a thin browser plugin.
